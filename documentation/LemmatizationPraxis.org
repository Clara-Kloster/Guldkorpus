* Lemmatization Praxis
** Words not found in Gammeldansk Ordbog
- compounds :: lemmatized as two parts separated by plus (+): af+vapn = /afvapn/
- Note all parts of compound need to be found in GDO; thus /komeskulende/ = kome + skule xVB
** POS tags
- Parts of speech (POS) are tagged for the part of speech as found in the lemma entry in GDO. For example, adjectives used adverbially such as /arlik/ are tagged as adjectives.
- all pronouns and determiners are tagged as xPD (not xPI, xPE, etc)
* For future lemmatization
- punctuation consistently tagged as "prop" or other
- /thær/ incorrectly lemmatized as /thæn/
- <j> never caught as /i/ (preposition)
- /ok/ not properly tagged as xCC
