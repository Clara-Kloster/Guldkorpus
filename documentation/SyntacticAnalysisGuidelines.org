* Sentence level
In general a /sentence/ is defined as a clause containing a single finite verb.

* Complex sentences
** Conjunctions
At times a sentence may contain two finite verbs combined with a conjunction such as /ok/ `and', /æller/ `or', etc. In such cases the conjunction is the root of the sentence, while the finite verbs are dependent on the conjunction:
