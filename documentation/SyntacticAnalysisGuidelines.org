* Sentence level
In general a /sentence/ is defined as a clause containing a single finite verb.

* Complex sentences
** Conjunctions
At times a sentence may contain two finite verbs combined with a conjunction such as /ok/ 'and', /æller/ 'or', etc. In such cases the conjunction is the root of the sentence/clause, while the finite verbs are dependent on the conjunction:

| (hwilkæn) | pa | boor | Lassæ | Brun | ok             | giuer | hwært | aar | thre | skiling | grat |
|           |    | (ok) |       |      | ROOT (hwilkæn) | (ok)  |       |     |      |         |      |

Note that /Lassæ (Brun)/ is the subject of both verbs in the above example, and is therefore dependent on the conjunction /ok/ as well:

| (hwilkæn) | pa | boor | Lassæ | Brun    | ok             | giuer | hwært | aar | thre | skiling | grat |
|           |    |      | (ok)  | (Lassæ) | ROOT (hwilkæn) |       |       |     |      |         |      |

The direct object /tre skiling grat/, on the other hand, is only the object of the verb /giuer/. Similarly the adverbial phrase /hwært aar/ is only dependent on /giuer/:

| (hwilkæn) | pa | boor | Lassæ | Brun | ok             | giuer | hwært | aar     | thre      | skiling | grat      |
|           |    |      |       |      | ROOT (hwilkæn) |       | (aar) | (giuer) | (skiling) | (giuer) | (skiling) |
